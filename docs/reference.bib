The Schwinger-DeWitt technique is generalized and converted into a tool for the calculation of any covariant loop graphs in the effective action. In particular, this technique is extended to nonminimal but causal operators of any order. All calculations are carried out in a universal manner using only the form of the commutator of covariant derivatives. We show that one can even tabulate the universal loop graphs and present a table of a certain class of such graphs. The article can also serve as a reference book on the divergences of one-loop graphs. In particular, we present a complete algorithm for divergences in the determinant of the fourth-order operator. The calculational methods are developed for the recently proposed unique effective action in gauge theories. The unique counterterms in Einstein's theory are computed, and the question of asymptotic freedom in this theory is reexamined.},

N = 2 spacetime supersymmetry implies that the “internal” N = 1 superconformal algebra with central charge ĉ = 6 splits into a piece with ĉ = 4 which has N = 4 superconformal invariance, and a piece with ĉ = 2 which is constructed from two free dimension 12 superfields. N = 4 spacetime supersymmetry requires that the entire ĉ = 6 algebra be represented by six free superfields. Using the world-sheet properties of N = 1 spacetime supersymmetric classical vacua, we show that spacetime supersymmetry cannot be continuously broken within a family of classical vacua. Finally, we argue that the effective field theories for classical vacua of superstring theories (whether spacetime supersymmetric or not) have no continuous global symmetries - all continuous symmetries are gauged.},

In particular, we conjecture that the near-flat limit of pure AdS belongs to the Swampland, as it is necessarily accompanied by an infinite tower of light states. The mass of the tower is power-law in the cosmological constant, with a power of 12 for the supersymmetric case. We discuss relations between this behaviour and other Swampland conjectures such as the censorship of an unbounded number of massless fields, and the refined de Sitter conjecture. Moreover, we propose that changes to the AdS radius have an interpretation in terms of a generalised distance conjecture which associates a distance to variations of all fields. In this framework, we argue that the distance to the Λ→0 limit of AdS is infinite, leading to the light tower of states. We also discuss implications of the conjecture for de Sitter space.},

	abstract = {The general nonlinear scalar model is studied at asymptotically low temperature near two dimensions. The low temperature expansion is renormalized and effective algorithms are derived for calculation to all orders in the renormalized expansion. The renormalization group coefficients are calculated in the two loop approximation and topological properties of the renormalization group equations are investigated. Special attention is paid to the infrared instabilities of the fixed points, since they provide the continuum limits of the model. The model consists of a scalar field φ on Euclidean 2 + ε space whose values φ(x) lie in a finite dimensional differentiable manifold M. The action is S(φ) = Λε f dx12T−1gij(φ(x))∂μφi(x) ∂μφj(x), where Λ−1 is the short distance cutoff and T−1gij is a (positive definite) Riemannian metric on M, called the metric coupling. The standard nonlinear models are the special cases in which M is a homogeneous space (the quotient GH of a Lie group G by a compact subgroup H) and gij is some G-invariant Riemannian metric on M. G acts as a global internal symmetry group. The renormalization of the model is divided into two parts: showing that the action retains its form under renormalization and showing that renormalization respects the action of the diffeomorphisms (i.e., the reparametrizations of transformations) of M. The techniques used are the standard power counting arguments combined with generalizations of the BRS transformation and the method of quadratic identities. The second part of the renormalization is crucial for renormalizing the standard models, since it implies the renormalization of internal symmetry. It is carried out to the point of identifying the finite dimensional cohomology spaces containing possible obstructions to the renormalization of the transformation laws, and of noting the absence of obstructions when M has finite fundarmental group and nonabelian semisimple isometry group. The renormalization group equation for the metric coupling is Λ−1(∂∂Λ−1)gij = −βij(g), βij(T−1g) = −εT−1gij + Rij + 12TRipqrRjpqr + O(T2). Ripqr is the curvature tensor and Rij = Ripjp the Ricci tensor of the metric gij. The β-function βij(g) is a vector field on the infinite dimensional space of Riemannian metrics on M. Two results on global properties of β are obtained. When M is a homogeneous space GH, the β-function is shown to be a gradient on the finite dimensional space of G-invariant metric couplings on M. And, when M is a two dimensional compact manifold, the β-function is shown to be a gradient on the infinite dimensional space of metrics on M. The rest of the results are concerned with fixed points. The fixed points are shown to correspond to the metrics satisfying a generalized Einstein equation, Rij−agij = ∇ivj + ∇jvi, a = ±1 or 0, for vi some vector field on M. Known solutions to these equations are discussed and some of their general properties described. In particular, it is shown that infrared instability occurs in at most a finite number of directions in the infinite dimensional space of metric couplings.},

Potential applications are briefly mentioned.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a technique for regularizing quadratic path integrals on a curved background spacetime. One forms a generalized zeta function from the eigenvalues of the differential operator that appears in the action integral. The zeta function is a meromorphic function and its gradient at the origin is defined to be the determinant of the operator. This technique agrees with dimensional regularization where one generalises ton dimensions by adding extra flat dimensions. The generalized zeta function can be expressed as a Mellin transform of the kernel of the heat equation which describes diffusion over the four dimensional spacetime manifold in a fith dimension of parameter time. Using the asymptotic expansion for the heat kernel, one can deduce the behaviour of the path integral under scale transformations of the background metric. This suggests that there may be a natural cut off in the integral over all black hole background metrics. By functionally differentiating the path integral one obtains an energy momentum tensor which is finite even on the horizon of a black hole. This energy momentum tensor has an anomalous trace.},
